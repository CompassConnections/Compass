### Why Compass is Money-Efficient

Compass is built entirely by volunteers and contributors, meaning every dollar donated goes **directly into infrastructure** (servers, hosting, maintenance).

- No salaries.
- No marketing budget.
- No hidden private spending.

This ensures that donations are never diluted â€” 100% of funds serve the mission of keeping Compass running and accessible.
