# Support Compass

Compass is and will always remain **free, ad-free, and community-owned**.  
Your contribution directly helps cover hosting, development, and community growth — ensuring Compass thrives as a gift for everyone.


## Ways to Contribute Financially

- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/CompassMeet) – one-time or ongoing monthly support
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/CompassConnections) – one-time or flexible contributions
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/CompassConnections) – increased transparency, but requires a GitHub account


## Why Donate?

- **Keep Compass sustainable** – cover server and infrastructure costs
- **Protect independence** – ensure we never need ads, subscriptions, or data sales
- **Empower contributors** – support ongoing development, moderation, and outreach


## Non-Financial Contributions

Donations aren’t the only way to help. You can also:
- Improve code or documentation
- Suggest features and test new builds
- Spread the word to thoughtful communities
- Help with design, moderation, or translations

Every small action adds up to something bigger.


**Thank you for being part of this mission.**  
Together, we’re building a platform for meaningful human connection — one that will never be captured by profit or advertising.
