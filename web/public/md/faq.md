# FAQ – Compass

### What is Compass?

Compass is a **free, open-source platform to help people form deep, meaningful, and lasting connections** — whether platonic, romantic, or collaborative.
Unlike typical apps, Compass prioritizes **values, interests, and personality over swipes and ads**, giving you full control over who you discover and how you connect.

### Who is Compass for?

Anyone who wants more than small talk or casual networking. If you value **depth over quantity** and want relationships grounded in **shared values, trust, and understanding**, Compass is for you.

### Why is Compass different from other meeting apps?

* **Keyword Search**: Find people who share your niche interests (e.g., “Minimalism”, “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, “Indie film”).
* **Transparent Database**: See all profiles, apply filters, and search freely — no hidden algorithms.
* **Notification System**: Get alerts when new people match your searches — no endless scrolling required.
* **Personality-Centered**: Values and ideas first. Photos stay secondary.
* **Democratic & Open Source**: Built by the community, for the community — no ads, no hidden monetization.

### Is Compass for dating or friendship?

Both. You can specify whether you’re looking for **platonic, romantic, or collaborative connections**.

### Who started Compass?

Compass was founded by [Martin Braquet](https://www.martinbraquet.com), an engineer and researcher passionate about tackling humanity’s most pressing challenges — from climate change and AI safety to animal welfare.

Martin has lived across Europe, the U.S., India, and Indonesia, immersing himself in diverse practices ranging from meditation retreats to sustainability-focused forest co-ops. These experiences shaped his conviction that deep one-to-one human connections are among the most meaningful drivers of well-being and positive change.

Compass grew out of that conviction. While Martin has long been driven to reduce global risks and suffering, he also recognized that his own life — and the lives of many others — would be greatly enriched by more profound, close, and supportive relationships. Compass is his attempt to build an open, transparent, and community-driven platform where people can connect around shared values, curiosity, and care, without the distractions of swipes, ads, or superficiality.

Martin continues to serve as an initiator and steward of Compass, but its direction is intentionally placed in the hands of the community through the Compass Constitution (as detailed in the next section).
