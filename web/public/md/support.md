# Support Compass

Compass is and will always remain **free, ad-free, and community-owned**.  
Your contribution directly helps cover hosting, development, and community growth — ensuring Compass thrives as a gift for everyone.


## Ways to Contribute Financially

- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/compass-connection) — or [directly from Compass](/donate)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/CompassConnections)
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/compassconnections)
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/CompassConnections) – requires a GitHub account
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/CompassMeet)
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/CompassConnections)


## Why Donate?

- **Keep Compass sustainable** – cover server and infrastructure costs
- **Protect independence** – ensure we never need ads, subscriptions, or data sales
- **Empower contributors** – support ongoing development, moderation, and outreach


## Non-Financial Contributions

Donations aren’t the only way to help. You can also:
- Improve [code or documentation](https://github.com/CompassConnections/Compass)
- [Suggest](https://forms.gle/tKnXUMAbEreMK6FC6) features and test new builds
- Spread the word to thoughtful communities
- Help with design, moderation, or translations

No contribution is too small—whether it’s changing a color, resizing a button, tweaking a font, or improving wording. Bigger contributions like adding new profile fields, building modules, or improving onboarding are equally welcome. The goal is to make the platform better step by step, and every improvement counts. If you see something that could be clearer, smoother, or more engaging, **please jump in**!

The complete, official list of tasks is available [here on ClickUp](https://sharing.clickup.com/90181043445/l/h/6-901810339879-1/bbfd32f4f4bf64b). If you are working on one task, just assign it to yourself and move its status to "in progress". If there is also a GitHub issue for that task, assign it to yourself as well.

To have edit access to the ClickUp workspace, you need an admin to manually give you permission (one time thing). To do so, just use your preferred option:
- DM an [admin](/members) here on Compass
- Ask or DM an admin on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8Vd7jzqjun)
- Email hello@compassmeet.com
- Raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/CompassConnections/Compass/issues)

**Thank you for being part of this mission.**  
Together, we’re building a platform for meaningful human connection — one that will never be captured by profit or advertising.
